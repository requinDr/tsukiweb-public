# Web port of Tsukihime
The goal is to provide an accessible modern way of reading an old, beautiful story.  

## Installation
The Progressive Web App (PWA) can be installed from the title screen using chromium-based browsers (_e.g._, Chrome, Edge, Opera).  
It offers a better experience in general.

To download the source code and run the game locally, follow the steps below:
1) install [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (version `18 / 20+` is required)
2) Get the source code: `git clone --recursive`
3) Install project dependencies with `npm i`
4) Start the localhost with `npm start`
5) Open your browser at the localhost address specified in the output of the previous command
